# Map file for tile-based game
#	(Lines that start with '#' are comments)
# Options of tiles:
#	1 			- 	Player1 spawn
#	2			-	Player2 spawn
#	<Space>		-	Empty location
#	P 			- 	PlatForm
# An idea for making this better: Input the levels as char, int pairs where the int tells how many of the character comes next. 
# that would make it a lot easier to make big levels
